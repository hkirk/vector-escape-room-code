*The old university server room was abandoned years ago after a failed AI experiment. Rumor has it that the ghost of a frustrated programmer still lingers, corrupting vector calculations in the dead of night. Your mission: Write tests to exorcise the bugs from the haunted Vector class before the ghost corrupts the entire system!*

*Youâ€™ll start by implementing basic vector operations from scratchâ€”no starter code! Then, youâ€™ll face the ghostâ€™s cursed implementations, where hidden bugs lurk in the shadows. Only your tests can reveal the truthâ€¦*


## Part 1 - ðŸ”¦ Starter Challenges
Each of the task below unlocks a password, you will need to unlock code for Part 2, you can exchange your passcode to C# code her: https://hkirk.github.io/vector-escape-room/.

The ghost hasnâ€™t touched these yetâ€¦ but itâ€™s watching. Implement these methods carefully, or it might sabotage your work later!

### 1) The Summoning (Vector Addition)

- Implement Vector.Add(Vector other) and write NUnit tests.
- Requirements:
  - Return a new Vector representing the sum of two vectors.
  - Throw an ArgumentException if the vectors have different lengths ("The ghost hates mismatched vectors!").

### 2) The Vanishing Act (Vector Subtraction)
- Implement Vector.Subtract(Vector other) and write NUnit tests.
- Requirements:
  - Return a new Vector representing the difference of two vectors.
  - Throw an ArgumentException if the vectors have different lengths ("The ghost will erase your work!").

### 3) The Shrinking Spell (Scalar Multiplication)
- Implement Vector.Scale(double scalar) and write NUnit tests.
- Requirements:
   - Return a new Vector where each component is multiplied by the scalar.
   - Handle scaling by zero ("The ghost turns your vector to dust!").

## Part 2 - ðŸ‘» Code Provided should be used

*The ghost has cursed these methods! Write tests to expose its tricks and fix the code before itâ€™s too lateâ€¦*


### 4) The Whispering Magnitude

- Write tests to uncover the ghostâ€™s mistakes and fix the method.
- Passkey Unlock: Revealed only if tests cover:
  - Non-zero vectors ("The ghost muffles the true magnitude!").
  - Zero vector ("The ghost hides in the silence of zero!").

### 5)The Cursed Dot Product

- Write tests to expose the ghostâ€™s sabotage and fix the method.
- Passkey Unlock: Revealed only if tests cover:
  - Non-zero dot product ("The ghost dilutes the truth!").
  - Zero dot product ("The ghost vanishes orthogonal vectors!").

### 6) The Phantom Normalizer

- Write tests to reveal the ghostâ€™s oversight and fix the method.
- Passkey Unlock: Revealed only if tests cover:
  - Normalization of a non-zero vector ("The ghost stretches your vectors!").
  - Zero vector ("The ghost howls at division by zero!").


## Part 3 - ðŸ’€ Boss Challenge: The Poltergeist Cross Product

The ghost saved its worst trick for last! This method is so corrupted, it might break your sanityâ€¦


- Write tests to uncover the ghostâ€™s final curse and fix the method.
  - Cross product of two 3D vectors ("The ghost twists space itself!").
  - Non-3D vectors ("The ghost cackles at invalid dimensions!").

## ðŸ“œ Epilogue: The Exorcism

*If youâ€™ve made it this far, congratulations! Youâ€™ve banished the ghost from the Vector classâ€¦ for now. But beware â€” it might return next semester. Keep your tests sharp!*
